# Predictive-Maintenance-Analysis
Machine learning model to predict equipment failures with 97% accuracy
# Predictive Maintenance Analysis for Scientific Equipment

## Overview
A machine learning project to predict equipment failures in scientific labs using sensor data. Built a logistic regression model achieving **97% accuracy**, identifying high-risk conditions to prevent downtime.

## Key Results
- **Accuracy**: 97% on test dataâ€”highly reliable predictions.  
- **Insight**: Temperatures above 300K increase failure risk by ~30%.  
- **Impact**: Reduced estimated downtime by 15 hours through early detection.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- Google Colab (developed on a smartphone)

## Files
- `Predictive_Maintenance_Analysis.ipynb`: Full code and analysis.  
- `risk.png`: Bar chart of failure risk by temperature.  
- `accuracy_screenshot.jpg`: Model accuracy output.

## Methodology
1. Loaded and cleaned sensor data (temperature, rotational speed).  
2. Trained a logistic regression model with scikit-learn.  
3. Evaluated accuracy and visualized failure risk by temperature bins.

## How to Run
Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab to explore or rerun the analysis.
